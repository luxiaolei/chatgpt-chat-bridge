# Architecture

## Purpose

ChatGPT Chat Bridge provides a small control plane for multiple chats inside a ChatGPT Project.

It does **not** try to replace GitHub project management and it does not make chat history the durable source of truth.

The core separation is:

- **GitHub Issues / PRs**: durable project state
- **ChatGPT chats**: long-lived execution contexts
- **chat-bridge**: routing/session/model/recovery control
- **Conductor chat**: orchestration policy and next-step decisions
- **Ego Lite / ego-browser**: native browser runtime

## Runtime layers

```

No desktop screen coordinates are required for the normal path.

## Registry

The bridge stores discovered and created sessions at:

```text
~/.config/chat-bridge/registry.json
```

A chat record contains fields such as:

```json
{
  "id": "conversation-id",
  "url": "https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-.../c/...",
  "name": "research-agent",
  "title": "Research",
  "project": "My Project",
  "model": "GPT-6 Pro",
  "effort": "Pro",
  "spaceId": 42,
  "page": "p1"
}
```

The registry is a routing cache, not the authoritative project state.

## Project sync

`chat-bridge sync --project NAME` opens the actual ChatGPT Project page and enumerates project-scoped conversation links.

This has two benefits:

1. project membership is read from the real Project UI rather than inferred from the global recent-chat sidebar;
2. project-scoped conversation URLs are refreshed in the registry.

## Session creation

`chat-bridge new` navigates to the target Project, configures the requested model/effort, sends the initial message, waits for ChatGPT to allocate a conversation ID, and registers the resulting session.

A session should normally map to one stable workstream or role.

## Model abstraction

The bridge separates:

- model radio selection
- thinking-effort slider

A normal configuration may be:

```text
GPT-5.6 Sol + High
```

The `GPT-6 Pro` bridge preset is intentionally represented as:

```text
Latest + Pro
```

because the current ChatGPT UI exposes the highest path through the `Latest` model choice plus the rightmost `Pro` thinking level.

## Message lifecycle

### Dispatch

```text
Conductor
  │
  ├─ update/read GitHub Issue
  │
  └─ chat-bridge send worker TASK
                         │
                         ▼
                    Worker Chat
```

### Completion callback

```text
Worker
  │
  ├─ update GitHub Issue / PR
  │
  └─ chat-bridge send conductor RESULT
                                  │
                                  ▼
                             Conductor Chat
                                  │
                                  ▼
                           next orchestration turn
```

A callback should carry a stable `task_id` and GitHub URL.

## Synchronous vs asynchronous routing

Use `ask` when the caller needs to block until the target chat finishes and directly consume the response.

Use `send` for event-style routing, especially worker-to-conductor callbacks.

## Recovery

The bridge exposes:

- `status`: inspect generation state and latest messages
- `stop`: stop an active generation
- `retry`: use a visible Retry/Regenerate control
- `resend`: resend the latest user message
- `recover`: combine stop → retry → resend fallback

Project state survives a broken chat because the authoritative task record is expected to be in GitHub.

## Conductor loop

A conductor should run a bounded orchestration loop:

1. reconcile GitHub state;
2. choose the next dispatch batch;
3. select/reuse/create sessions;
4. allocate model and thinking effort;
5. dispatch;
6. receive callbacks;
7. verify GitHub evidence;
8. continue.

Only the conductor should normally fan out new work. Worker-to-worker delegation should be exceptional and must preserve task IDs and hop limits.

## Local execution

Some worker tasks need local capabilities such as filesystem access, GUI automation, builds, or private browser state.

Two supported patterns are:

- Chat → Remote Desktop Commander → local CLI/tools
- Chat/Codex → local or Web Codex environment → local CLI/tools

For tasks that do not need local state, prefer direct Chat + GitHub work.

## Security boundary

The runtime controls a logged-in browser profile. Any process with access to the same user account and local browser control surface may be able to affect that session.

Do not expose the local runtime to untrusted users and do not commit browser state or the local registry.
